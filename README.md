# Tic_Tac_Toe_Object_Oriented

It is the Object Oriented version of Tictactoe program

## Notes

First version executable is ready in bin folder. I created and tested it on Windows 10 using MinGW/GCC by executing following command in project folder:

g++ -lstdc++ -std=c++17 -o bin/binary_for_windows main.cpp

The executable file for windows (.exe) is in folder "bin"
